# Curriculum Instructions

## Introduction
Welcome and thank you for choosing Game4Edu! This course is designed for students aged 11 to 14 and uses game development as a method for teaching computer programming. The course is split into 8 sessions that are an hour each. The goal of this course is to provide an outlet for the students to learn valuable skills in a way that is fun for them. The course is designed around GameMaker 2, an easy to use game development tool that allows users to make games with little to no prior programming knowledge. Below, weâ€™ve provided download instructions as well as some useful resources for GameMaker and the course itself.

## Downloading GameMaker 2.0
Follow this [link](https://www.yoyogames.com/get) to create a free YoYo games account and download the trial version for the latest version of GameMaker 2.0. All of this course can be completed using the trial version.

Contact Nathan, Doug, or Tyler if you have any remaining questions.

## Assessments
>This course is designed to be assessed before and after the course. Both the Pretest and Posttest are split into two parts, an assessment of conceptual understanding and opinonated survey.

# Course Map
> If there is ever any time at the end of a session, let the students tinker with the code presented to them
## Hour 1
- Course Description
- Administer Pretest
- Open/Install GameMaker 2.0
- Open new project
- Give Overview of UI
- Discuss Sprites, Objects, Rooms, Events, and running the game
- Show Drag and Drop code

## Hour 2
- Open Checkers project
- Show them how to place objects on the board through the Room
- Work on movement components
- Introduce conditional logic and variables
- Introduce event-driven programming
- Introduce the game loop and win conditions

## Hour 3
- Open Checkers project
- Introduce refactoring by placing the pieces on the board through looping
- Implement capturing *(Consider recursion as a way to capture multiple pieces)*
- Implement the King concept with inheritance
- Allow students to do what they want with the game for the remainder of class
> Possible suggestions could be to make the board bigger, creating alternate piece types, or adding another player

## Hour 4
- Let students play each others games and provide feedback
- After they play 2-3 different versions, move on
- Introduce the Platformer project
- Open the project
- Create a player sprite and object
- Create a ground sprite and object
- Set up a room with a player character and some ground
- Implement basic movements for the character

## Hour 5
- Open platformer project
- Discuss documentation of code
- Add gravity and jumping
- Add win condition
- Add score and coin pickups
- Document all of these features

## Hour 6
- Open platformer project
- Implement a life system
- Implement base enemy character
- Give a brief tutorial of animation
- Let the students modify the game in any way they want
> Some suggestions are multiple enemy types, power item pickups, time constraints, different terrain

## Hour 7
- Continue with platformer implementation (see last steps of Hour 6)

## Hour 8
- Begin class with the posttest survey and assessment
- Let the students play, review, and provide feedback for other students games
